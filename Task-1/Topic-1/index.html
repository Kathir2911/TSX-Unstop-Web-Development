    <h2>Topic 1: The Core Trio - HTML Structure, Basic CSS Styling, and 
Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
    <h3>HTML STRUCTURE</h3>
    <p class="htmlcontent">HTML <strong>(HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the standard language used to create web pages. A basic HTML document starts with <strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong> to define the document type. It contains two main sections:  the &lthead&gt and the &ltbody&gt. The <strong>&lthead&gt</strong> includes meta-information like the page title and links to stylesheets, while the <strong>&ltbody&gt</body></strong> contains the visible content such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. All content is enclosed within the &lthtml&gt tag, which marks the start and end of the document.</p>
    <h3>BASIC CSS STYLING</h3>
    <p class="csscontent">Basic CSS styling is used to change the appearance of HTML elements on a webpage. With CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you can control the <strong>layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more</strong>. <strong>For example</strong>, you can change text color using color, set background with background-color, align text with text-align, and apply margins or padding to elements. CSS can be written inline, internally within a <strong>&ltstyle&gt</strong> tag, or externally in a separate .css file linked to the HTML. This helps make web pages more attractive and easier to read.</p>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    <p class="jscontent">JavaScript is a versatile, <strong>high-level programming language</strong> primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs directly in web browsers, allowing developers to build features like animations, form validations, and real-time updates. Alongside<strong> HTML and CSS, JavaScript</strong> is one of the core technologies of web development. Its ease of use, vast ecosystem, and ability to work on both the front end and back end (with environments like Node.js) make it one of the most popular and widely used programming languages today.</p>
